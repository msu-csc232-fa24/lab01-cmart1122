# My name is Chase Martin; I'm a graduate student at Missouri State Univeristy. I got my undergraduate degree at Purdue University in Mechanical Engineering. I played college baskebtall at Purdue University and I transffered to Missouri State for my last year of eligibility. I've always enjoyed CS, so I chose the program for my masters.
